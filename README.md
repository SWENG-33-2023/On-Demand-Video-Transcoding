# On-Demand-Video-Transcoding

Software Engineering Project with ShutterStock  
Project is from a Trinity Module for third and second years

## Project Information

We have been tasked with creating an on demand video transcoding application.
We will be using ReactJS for the front end and a Python API using flask for the majority of the back end.

## Project Initialisation

NOTE: For all installation steps additional steps will probably be required, which google can help with.

## Front End

1. Install NodeJS [here][3], this comes with Node Package manager(NPM).
2. A ReactJS app should already be created but if you ever want to create your own ReactJS app with "boiler-plate" code input `npx create-react-app my-app` into your console.
3. If all the dependencies are not installed on your system, type `npm i` into the console while in this directory.
4. Run the website off your local machine by typing `npm start` into your console.

### Back End

1. Install sqlite3 to work with the data base [here][1].
2. Install Python however you want, either on the Microsoft store or online.
3. Install pip, the Python package manager to be able to download dependencies [here][2], and put it in the same folder you downloaded Python in.
4. In your Command Line Interface(e.g. Bash, CMD, Terminal) input `pip install pip`.
5. Clone this repository and create your own branch.
6. In the repository folder, in your CLI of choice input `pip install sqlite3` and `pip install flask`. (It shouldn't matter which directory you type it in but to be safe do it in the Repo)
7. Install ffmpeg [here][4], I recommend downloading from the packages and executable files, otherwise you'll have to compile it yourself.
8. Follow a tutorial on how to install ffmpeg.
9. Run the Python API by pressing F5.
